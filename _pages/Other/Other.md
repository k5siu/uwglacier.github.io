This page describes any other useful tools or things you've learned that might help others.

## Documentation
There are a few different ways to build online documentation for your projects. This documentation could be a few simple pages to share your model/code/etc. within this group, or it could be public documentation you publish along with a model you develop.

 * [Readthedocs](https://uwglacier.github.io/other/rtd): Free online documentation hosting based on Markdown or Sphinx with Github integration.
 * [Github Pages](https://uwglacier.github.io/other/pages): Similar to Readthedocs, but hosted by github. This is how this wiki site is built! Github Pages can build documentation from Markdown (like for this wiki), or can host html pages. This makes Github pages more flexible than RTD.

## Latex
Latex can be a good tool for writing papers that include a lot of math, and is strongly encouraged for [Applied math theses](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-waterloo-thesis-template/rndjnzvhjqfk).
